# NewsFlow
Basic RSS Reader written by Ty Jacobs in Swift2

This app was developed to meet the requirements for a "Code Test" by A&F in July 2015.

I also used it to develop my skills in Swift2 and other current iOS development practices.

The app runs on ANY size iOS device and works online or offline as specified in the requirements.  It does so by saving news stories in a simple Core Data database on the device.
